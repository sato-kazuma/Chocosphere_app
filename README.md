# Chocosphere Analytics

ChocoSphere Analytics is a desktop application for analyzing, managing and simulating sales data for a global premium chocolate chain.
The project was born with the aim of demonstrating data modeling skills, the use of relational databases, modular software development, and business-oriented data analysis.
The application provides an intuitive graphical interface that allows you to:
explore sales data through interactive dashboards;
modify and validate transactional data (CRUD);
run scenario simulations (what-if analysis) without altering the real data;
analyze performance by product, country and sales force.
The architecture is designed according to the principle of separation of responsibilities, with fully decoupled business logic, data access and user interface.
The database uses a relational model optimized for analysis (star schema), while SQL queries are encapsulated and invisible to the end user, simulating a real-world application context.

# Development choices

Desktop application developed in Python with GUI, SQLite database and modular architecture. 
The project implements relational data modeling, CRUD operations, encapsulated SQL queries, analytical dashboards, and business scenario simulations, following clean architecture and separation of concerns principles.
